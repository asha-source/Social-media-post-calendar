DESCRIPTION:

 This document explains the Python code used to generate a 30-day social media content calendar
 in Excel format.
 
 1. Libraries Used:- pandas: To manage tabular data.- datetime, timedelta: To handle dates and calculate each day in the calendar.
 2. Step 1: Define Start Date and Total Days
 The script sets today's date as the starting point and prepares content for 30 days.
 3. Step 2: Create Placeholder Content
 A loop runs 30 times, each time:- Generates the date.- Creates sample text for post idea, caption, hashtags, and image idea.- Stores each day's info in a dictionary and adds it to a list.
 4. Step 3: Convert List to DataFrame
 The list of dictionaries is converted to a pandas DataFrame, making it easy to export.
 5. Step 4: Export to Excel
 The DataFrame is saved as 'social_media_calendar.xlsx' using the to_excel() function.
 6. Output:
 The resulting Excel file includes columns:- Date
- Post Idea- Caption- Hashtags- Image Idea
 This can be customized based on the brand (e.g., food, fashion, tech) by modifying the placeholder text.
